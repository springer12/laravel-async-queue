# Laravel Async Queue Driver
## Push a function/closure to the background.

Just like the 'sync' driver, this is not a real queue driver. It is always fired immediatly.
The only difference is that the closure is sent to the background without waiting for the response.

Note: Alpha release, only tested on Linux.

### Install
Add the package to the require section of your composer.json and run `composer update`

    "barryvdh/laravel-async-queue": "dev-master"

Add the Service Provider to the providers array in config/app.php

    'Barryvdh\Queue\AsyncServiceProvider',

You should now be able to use the async driver in config/queue.php


    'default' => 'async',
    
    'connections' => array(
        ...
        'async' => array(
            'driver' => 'async',
        ),
        ...
    }

It should work the same as the sync driver, so no need to run a queue listener. Downside is that you cannot actually queue or plan things.
Queue::later() is also fired directly.
